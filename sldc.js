// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisOfRequirements = `The second step includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes.`
let design = `This is when developers will first outline the details for the overall application`
let Implementation = `In this phase the intended business functions of the software/code are added.`
let testingAndInegration = `The software is tested to make sure that there arent any bugs and then the information system will be integrated into its environment and eventually installed. `
let maintain = `Developer must now handle issues reported by end-users and any changes that the software might need after deployment.`
